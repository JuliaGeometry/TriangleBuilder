# TriangleBuilder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaGeometry/TriangleBuilder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaGeometry/TriangleBuilder)

This repository builds shared libraries of [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) by J. R. Shewchuk 
as binary artifacts for  [Triangle.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Triangulate.jl).

Binary artifacts are automatically uploaded to
[this repository's GitHub releases page](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/TriangleBuilder/releases) whenever a tag is created
on this repository.

This repository was created using [BinaryBuilder.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl)
